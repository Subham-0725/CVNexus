## Problem Statement — Why Resumes Fail ATS

**Purpose:** Validate user frustration and create urgency.

### Title
Why Most Resumes Never Reach a Recruiter

### Explanation
- Over **70% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems** before human review.
- Common reasons:
  - Non-standard formatting
  - Keyword mismatch
  - Tables, icons, columns ATS can’t parse
  - Design-heavy templates that break extraction

**Key Truth:**  
Most candidates don’t fail because they’re unqualified.  
They fail because their resume is unreadable to software.
